# ChatterUp
Developed a realtime chatting application using Socket Programming

In this project I have worked on Socket Programming to build chatting application that deliveres users responses in realtime. I have integrated MongoDB Atlas to store all the required users data.

# What is Socket Programming
Socket programming is a method of communication between computers over a network using sockets. A socket is essentially a communication endpoint that allows processes on different devices to send and receive data. 

In socket programming, one computer can act as a server, waiting for incoming connections, while another computer acts as a client, initiating a connection to the server. The communication can involve sending and receiving messages, files, or any other form of data. 

Sockets provide a flexible and standardized way for different programs or devices to communicate, making it a fundamental concept in network programming and enabling the development of various networked applications like web servers, chat applications, and more.
